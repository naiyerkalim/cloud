//SVN vs Git
 //Centralized vs. Distributed:
 // SVN (Subversion): Utilizes a centralized model where there is a single, centralized repository that stores the entire version history. Developers must be connected to this central repository to access and commit changes.
 // Git: Operates on a distributed model where each user has a complete local copy of the repository, including the entire version history. This allows developers to work offline and commit changes locally before synchronizing with a remote repository.

//Branching and Merging:
 // SVN: Branches and merges are more complex and can be time-consuming. Branches are essentially copies of the entire directory structure, which can lead to more cautious branching strategies.
 // Git: Branching and merging are lightweight and integral to the system. Branches in Git are highly efficient as they only contain changes made since the branch diverged from its parent, enabling easier experimentation and collaboration.
